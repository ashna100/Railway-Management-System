General Coaches
AC 3-tier Economy (3E)
On 1 October 2009 a new class was introduced: Third AC Economy (3E). The class is designated for the 
coaches, which have an additional berth in the side section (SM type - Side Middle). This type of 
accommodation is created for less well off people, who wish to travel in AC 3-tier for a lesser price.

The following table lists the classes in operation. Not all classes may be attached to a rake though.

Class[1]	Description[1][2]
1A	First class AC: This is the most expensive class, where the fares are almost at par with air fare. There 
are eight cabins (including two coupes) in the full AC First Class coach and three cabins (including one
coupe) in the half AC First Class coach. The coach has an attendant to help the passengers. Bedding is
included with the fare in IR. This air conditioned coach is present only on popular routes and can carry 
18 passengers (full coach) or 10 passengers (half coach). The sleeper berths are extremely wide and 
spacious. The coaches are carpeted, have sleeping accommodation and have privacy features like personal
coupes. This class is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.
2A	AC-Two tier: These air-conditioned coaches have sleeping berths across eight bays. Berths are usually
arranged in two tiers in bays of six, four across the width of the coach and two berths longways on the
other side of the corridor, with curtains along the gangway or corridor. Bedding is included with the
fare. A broad gauge coach can carry 48 passengers (full coach) or 20 passengers (half coach). This class
is available on broad gauge and metre gauge trains.
FC	First class: Same as 1AC but without air conditioning. No bedding is available in this class. The berths
are wide and spacious. There is a coach attendant to help the passengers. This class has been phased out
on most of the trains and is rare to find. However narrow gauge trains to hill stations have this class.
3A	AC three tier: Air conditioned coaches with 64 sleeping berths. Berths are usually arranged as in 
2AC but with three tiers across the width and two longways as before giving eight bays of eight. They 
are slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is included 
with fare. It carries 64 passengers in broad gauge. This class is available only on broad gauge.
3E	AC three tier (Economy): Air conditioned coaches with sleeping berths, present in Garib Rath Trains.

slightly less well-appointed, usually no reading lights or curtained off gangways. Bedding is not included
with fare.

between cities.

total of four seats in a row used for day travel between cities. This class of travel is only available on 
Shatabdi Express trains.
Double Decker	Double Decker: These are found in both AC and Non-AC rakes. AC Double Deck sitter
coaches used in Double Decker Express. AC Double Deck sleeper will be used by newly proposed Uday
Express. Non-AC Double Deck sitter were introduced to few Mumbai-Pune trains and the Flying Ranee.

could be attached. These are regular sleeping coaches with three berths vertically stacked. In broad 
gauge, it carries 72 passengers per coach.
2S	Seater class: same as AC Chair car, without the air-conditioning. These may be reserved in advance 
or may be unreserved.
UR/GEN	Unreserved/General: The cheapest accommodation. The seats are usually made up of pressed
wood in older coaches but cushioned seats are found in new coaches. These coaches are usually 
over-crowded and a seat is not guaranteed. Tickets are issued in advance for a minimum journey of 
more than 24 hours. Tickets issued are valid on any train on the same route if boarded within 24 hours
of buying the ticket.
Deen Dayalu	Deen Dayalu: These are non reserved coaches for long distance trains.
Classification of berths[edit]
Berths are classified as follows:

LB = Lower Berth
MB = Middle Berth
UB = Upper Berth
SUB = Side Uprth
SMB = Side Middle Berth (Found in AC 3-tier Economy class)
This is applicable to the Broad Gauge coaches, however on the Metre Gauge, coaches don't have 
side berths (SLB, SMB & SUB). While the Narrow Gauge coaches don't have sleeper berths.

Indian Railways is mostly composed of (Indian) Broad Gauge, while the already less Meter Gauge is 
being phased out, with mostly undergoing a Gauge Conversion, to the Broad Gauge. A remaining 
exception will be the Narrow Gauge rail. Two of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Darjeeling 
Himalayan Railway and the Nilgiri Mountain Railway.

On Broad Gauge trains, there would normally be 64 seats/berths for 3 tier AC coaches (3A) and 72 
seats/berths for 3 tier Sleeper coaches (SL) with the coaches having four entrances two each on either 
sides of the coach at their ends. These coaches would display the seat/berth numbers painted just 
above each of their windows that would be in alignment to that particular window. The Higher classes
have reduction in their seating/berth capacity, for passenger comfort, based on their class respectively. 
New LHB rakes have 72 seats/berths for 3 tier AC coaches (3A).

Middle berths are found in AC 3-tier Economy class coaches (3E), these coaches are meant for not so 
well off people, who desire a comfortable travel at lesser fare.

The second sitting have 108 seats but with two additional entrances right in the middle of the coaches
on their either sides. Therefore these coaches have six entrances.");
