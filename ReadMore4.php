echo("The Indian Railways along with the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation provides
a wide range of luxury rail travel in India. There are five tourist trains and three categories of superfast
passenger rail services availed by the Indian railways. Indian Railways has recently decided to introduce
luxurious Anubhuti Coaches in regular Trains, which would be similar to coaches in Luxury Trains like
Maharaja Express or Palace on Wheels.[1] However the Kolkata Metro Railway, which is also the 17th
Zone of the Indian Railways also comes under the Luxury railways in India.

tourism in Rajasthan, and has been highly popular since its launch. The train service was refurbished 
and relaunched in August 2009 with a new decor, itinerary and cuisine. The concept of the Palace
on Wheels was derived from the royal background of the coaches, which were originally meant to be
the personal railway coaches of the erstwhile rulers of the princely states of Rajputana, Gujarat, the 
Nizam of Hyderabad and the Viceroy of British India. Each coach has four cabins (named chambers or 
saloons by the company) with twin beds, wall-to-wall carpeting, air-conditioning, DTH satellite

attendants.
