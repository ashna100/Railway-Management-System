echo("These tickets can be booked over the counter in a railway station and on the internet through the
website of IRCTC.

Ticket booking under Tatkal scheme opens at 10:00 AM on the day before the date of the journey from the
train's origin station. The day of the journey is defined as the day of chart preparation.
Booking starts at 10:00 am for AC coaches and for sleeper coaches it starts from 11:00 am.
There are no separate trains defined as Tatkal trains. Non-utilized Tatkal tickets are released to passengers
on a waiting list. Confirmed Tatkal tickets can be cancelled but no refunds are given. Tatkal tickets on the
waiting list may be cancelled and refunded.
On those trains and in those cases where the average utilization of Tatkal accommodation during the
peak period of April to September is 80% and above, the Tatkal charges that are applicable during the
peak period will be charged throughout the year, i.e., for both the peak and the non-peak periods.
Premium Tatkal[edit]
A new booking system called Premium Tatkal was introduced on October 1, 2014 through which half
of the tickets on certain trains are dynamically priced. These tickets can be purchased online only.
The Indian Railways company started implementing this system with a pilot of about 80 trains. Premium
Tatkal and regular Tatkal tickets operate in the same manner");
