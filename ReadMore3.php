Rail transport is a means of conveyance of passengers and goods on wheeled vehicles running
on rails, also known as tracks. It is also commonly referred to as train transport. In contrast to road
transport, where vehicles run on a prepared flat surface, rail vehicles (rolling stock) are directionally
guided by the tracks on which they run. Tracks usually consist of steel rails, installed on ties (sleepers)
and ballast, on which the rolling stock, usually fitted with metal wheels, moves. Other variations are also
possible, such as slab track, where the rails are fastened to a concrete foundation resting on a prepared
subsurface.

Rolling stock in a rail transport system generally encounters lower frictional resistance than road vehicles,
so passenger and freight cars (carriages and wagons) can be coupled into longer trains. The operation is
carried out by a railway company, providing transport between train stations or freight customer facilities.
Power is provided by locomotives which either draw electric power from a railway electrification system or
produce their own power, usually by diesel engines. Most tracks are accompanied by a signalling system.
Railways are a safe land transport system when compared to other forms of transport.[Nb 1] Railway
transport is capable of high levels of passenger and cargo utilization and energy efficiency, but is often
less flexible and more capital-intensive than road transport, when lower traffic levels are considered.

The oldest, man-hauled railways date back to the 6th century BC, with Periander, one of the Seven
Sages of Greece, credited with its invention. Rail transport blossomed after the British development
of the steam locomotive as a viable source of power in the 18th and 19th centuries. With steam
engines, one could construct mainline railways, which were a key component of the Industrial Revolution.
Also, railways reduced the costs of shipping, and allowed for fewer lost goods, compared with water
transport, which faced occasional sinking of ships. The change from canals to railways allowed for
national markets in which prices varied very little from city to city. The invention and development
of the railway in Europe was one of the most important technological inventions of the 19th century;
in the United States, it is estimated that without rail, GDP would have been lower by 7% in 1890.
