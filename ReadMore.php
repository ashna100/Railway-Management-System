echo("A train ticket is a ticket issued by a railway operator that enables the bearer to travel on the
operator's network or a partner's network. Tickets can authorize the bearer to travel a set itinerary
at a specific time (common for long-distance railroads), a set itinerary at any time (common for
commuter railroads), a set itinerary at multiple times, or an arbitrary itinerary at specific times.
(The last two categories are often called passes: the former is often sold as a discounted block
of trips for commuters; the latter is often sold to vacationersfor instance, European Eurail passes.)

PRR passenger seat check c1960
In the US a conductor may also provide the passenger with a seat check  another voucher
indicating how
far the passenger may travel on the system  or attach it over the seat also punched by the
conductor
showing the passenger's destination. Some systems (Amtrak, for instance) have two-part tickets
that permit
the passenger to retain a cancelled ticket stub; others (the New Jersey Transit and MBTA
commuter rail
systems, for instance) do not. Seat checks are changed frequently to ensure that passengers
cannot retain
and reuse them from journey to journey. (Conductors typically collect checks before stops to
prevent this.)

In some countries, like Italy, and some local railways in Germany, conductors are not used.
Instead passengers
are expected to validate tickets in a special stamping machine before entering the train. A
system of coupons
that are validated with a special machine exists on the Mumbai Suburban Railway where
combinations of
coupons of different denominations are used to get the corresponding ticket value.[1]
There may or may not
be a conductor later on double-checking that correct tickets are actually held. Yet further
systems are possible,
for example in Japan, the London Underground and in local traffic in Stockholm, the
platforms are physically
blocked, forcing the acquisition of a ticket before entering the platform.

Some train tickets are available with an option to add bus travel at either end of the train ticketed journey,
as
part of a wider transport network. For instance, the PLUSBUS scheme in the United Kingdom offers
additional
bus travel on an integrated ticket for a fee of between 2 and 4.[2][3] In Germany most long distance
train
tickets include a city ticket valid on the public transit system of origin and destination. This is
automatically
included at no extra charge in all tickets purchased by Bahn Card holders and is indicated
on the ticket.");
